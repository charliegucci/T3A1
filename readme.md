## Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project

---

Let say you want to check source code or files from start to finish, Version Control or Source control is a tool most projects used. It functions as a time machine in which you can go back from history to present.
| # | Functions of Version Control(Source Control) |
| :------- | :-------------- |
| Backup and Restore | All your work will be saved, edited and can be restored in the beginning up to the recent changes. |
| Synchronization | People working in the project can collaborate with source codes and will let them update to the current one.|
| Short-term undo | If we made any errors and don't know how to fixed it, we can just disregard the changes and go back to the last known working state.|
| Long-term undo | If theres already a lot of source code written and let say they have tag with versions, We can go over it and check the logs for that tag.|
| Track Changes | Any changes we made, let say adding, removing, updating or deleting files, we can comment message for that certain change or changes making it easy for yourself or others when you go back and had a look on how your work had developed overtime.|
| Track Ownership | All the changes that you've made will be reflected under however made those revisions so everyone working on that file will know whoever is responsible. |
| Sandboxing | Basically, you can test whatever you want to change before committing and deploying your changes.|
| Branching and merging | This provides us an option for our code to be modular. We can segregate major changes, test it before we merge it back to the working state.|
<br>

| #                        | Basic Setup                                                  |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository (repo)        | This will be your online database thats stores your code.    |
| Server                   | This will be your local machine which stores the repository. |
| Client                   | This will be your computer connecting to the repository.     |
| Working Set/Working Copy | This will be your local files where you made changes.        |
| Trunk/Main               | This will be the main line for your code in the repository.  |

<br>

### Examples:

#### Checkins

![checkins](docs/basic_checkin.png) <br/>
\*\*\* In this example, each time we made a change or add something to a code, it provides references <br>

#### Checkouts And Editing

![checkout_edit](docs/checkout_edit.png) <br/>
\*\*\* In this example, everthing time you check in youl be given the recent version of the code and can go back to previous ones.<br/>

#### Difference

![diffs](docs/basic_diffs.png) <br/>
\*\*\* In this example, we can see the difference between every stages weve made.<br/>

#### Branching

![branch](docs/first_branch.png) <br/>
\*\*\* In this example, we can sandbox any changes we want to implement before adding it to the working state.<br/>

#### Merging

![merge](docs/merging.png) <br/>
\*\*\* In this, example after making those changes in the branch, we added those changes in the main one.<br/>

#### Conflict

![conflict](docs/conflict.png) <br/>
\*\*\* In this example, we can see two those changes which is different and gives conflict on which is right or wrong before merging to the main state<br/>

#### Tagging

![tagging](docs/tagging.png) <br/>
\*\*\* In this example, we can tag changes so that it will be easier to reference.<br>

## What are the most important aspects of quality software

---

The following are aspects in measuring the quality of a software:

| Aspect of Quality Software | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reliability                | A reliable software should be consistent and plenty software testing is imperative prior to deployment to minimise errors. There is no such thing as a zero-bug software however a reliable software should have very few faults and these faults should be fixed in a timely manner. |
| Understandability          | A software developer must exercise clear, highly organised and logical structured code. It is difficult to manage a software if it is poorly written. It also affects the effectivity and efficiency during bug-fixing and testing if code is not done in an organised way.           |
| Modifiability              | Similar to understandability, if a software is well-organised, it is easy to make modifications. It should be flexible and any changes to be done should be also be easy to deploy when done.                                                                                         |
| Usability                  | One of the purposes of a software development is to meet specific needs of a client. This can be achieved when a software is effective, and it can only be effective if the user is comfortable using the software after a short training.                                            |
| Testability                | Testability â€“ Quality of a software depends on testability. If the errors are found and corrected prior deployment, the software becomes reliable. Testing saves time, effort and costs.                                                                                              |
| Portability                | A software should be able to work in multiple environments and can be transferred to another environment and still work properly with small changes.                                                                                                                                  |
| Efficiency                 | An efficient software should use very little physical resources as can possibly get but still perform a function as required.                                                                                                                                                         |

## Outline a standard high level structure for a MERN stack application and explain the components

---

![mern](docs/mern.jpg) <br/>

MERN stack is one of the JavaScript web app stacks that is being used in creating web applications. Its main purpose is to create effective, efficient, fast and flexible web applications by putting together these four components â€“ MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.<br/>

| Components | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MongoDB    | Compared to other database, MongoDB is a document database which is non relational (NOSQL) and doesn't use schema formats like tables and columns. The data format of the document is query through Javascript Object Notation (JSON).                          |
| Express    | A back-end or server side framework. Its considered web application framework for Node. It simplifies the task of writing server side codes. Known for its speed and minimalist structure, which features many available plugins which will make your code DRY. |
| React      | It is one of javaScript libraries for client side interface. It was created by Facebook. Its library is used for creating views in HTML. React views are declarative which automate the creation of repetitive HTML or DOM elements.                            |
| Node.js    | A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment which is built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It is designed to run Javascript code with multiple files.                                                                                                     |

| Programming                                                   | there are plenty of programming languages available and they are created for different purposes. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three most popular. HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language, it is used in creating pages in web browser. Contents and links that can be viewed in the web pages are done using HTML. CSS means Cascading Style Sheets, this allows programmer to create style on pages. Colours, fonts and layout that we view in web pages are done using CSS. JavaScript on the other hand is .... |
| Learning                                                      | Web developers should not only know how about programming languages but also knowledgeable about the project. It is important that the programmer is aware of the purpose why there is a project and able to meet expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Testing                                                       | Testing during the development phase and prior to delivering the final product are equally both important. This is to save time, money and make sure everything is working fine to satisfy customer requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Basic Knowledge of Design                                     | A developer should have basic understanding in graphic design or using graphic tools. This assists the developer into building the website as to what the customer desires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| SEO                                                           | It is important for a developer to have understanding on how search engines work. As the team is developing a website for a small business, it is vital for the business to have online presence and increase customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Understanding Common Security Attacks and How to Prevent Them | Protecting website from Cybersecurity attacks are essential. Any website developer should have a basic understanding of different types and how to prevent as such. These could pose serious threats to businesses if not considered at time of web development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Image Resizing and Effects                                    | A website developer should be familiar in using Photoshop or related graphics editor. In this day and age, customers are more inclined into visually minded web pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Resoluteness                                                  | Resoluteness is a character of a person rather than a skill. It takes an adequate of determination to learn from mistakes, fixing the problem and finishing a task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Confidence                                                    | A website developer should stay focused on his task and believe in oneâ€™s self that it can be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Frustration Tolerance and Patience                            | When working on a project, there are plenty of testing that needs to be done. It is important that the developer does not give up when faced with trials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Time Management and Detailed Planning                         | It very important for the team to do lots of planning when working on a project. A project management software or applications can be used to delegate tasks, managing hours and tracking progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## With reference to one of your own projects, discuss what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and to overcome challenges

---

In relation to my last rails project (marketplace app), listed below were the knowledge or skills required and challenges encountered;<br/>

| Knowledge / Skills           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Programming                  | As part of the requirement, we need to create the application using Ruby on Rails. Upon learning Ruby on the first term, it helps to learn the basics for the MVC framework such as Ruby on Rails. Also learning HTML and CSS in term 1 contributes in designing and styling the Client-side of the application.                                                                                                                                    |
| Learning                     | Before or as you build the project, you will encounter some ideas that you want to implement in the application. Most of the time, these will include a lot of reading documentations and even watching tutorials on how it works. Some of these concept were not taught in school so you need to do a lot of research.                                                                                                                             |
| Testing                      | As we build along the project, we make sure that we test the application after every feature we implement. This include testing on both development and production. By doing that, it helps us narrow down the source of errors or bugs if theres any.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Design                       | By learning HTML and CSS on the first term, we managed to implement some knowledge and techniques to our design. The use of wireframes and mood boards helps us layout the basic design and build up as we go along. Learning CSS libraries such as Bootstrap and Bulma contributes well for the overall user experience.                                                                                                                           |
| Time Management and Planning | Whether youâ€™re in school learning or at work for a company, we need to stay on top of your schedule and your projects This can mean getting to know productivity apps like task lists or calendars or, especially if youâ€™re in a large organization. We've used project tracking tools like Trello to keep track on the development of the project. Whatever the tools, mastering the art of prioritizing and tracking your work will be essential. |

| Challenges Encountered | How we overcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time Limitation        | Delivering a project in a very short period of time was challenging. Judgment and emotions affect decision making when working under pressure. Using Trello and Canban methodology, we were able to manage our time and tasks.                                                                                                                              |
| User-friendly Design   | End users of the project does not have understandings of how the website was done or what programming languages were used. They are more concerned of what the web pages will look like, how appealing it is and how easy it is to navigate. Usability can be perspective. We asked our educators and associates to test the website and get some feedback. |

## With reference to one of your own projects, evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were for this project, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature

---

If given chance to redo everything, il will consider;
| Steps | Changes |
| :------- | :-------------- |
| Reevaluate | Using my knowledge in software development, learning new skills and plenty of testing, I was able to finish the project. In future projects, it will be great to work in teams so we can collaborate, share the load and increase efficiency.|
| Figure out the failures | Creating a project and learning new things can be quite exciting. During planning, I was inclined to add plenty of features not realising how complicated it can be and that it took much of my time trying to figure out how to do it. In future projects, I would still want to add a feature or two that I know the end user will appreciate, to challenge myself but also make sure that it can be done within the time-frame.|
<br/>
I could say that with reference to my projects they were satisfactory for me and probably for others and the skills and knowledge that I acquired while studying equipped me on how to proceed.<br/>

## Explain control flow, using an example from the JavaScript programming language

---

Most of our code involves control flow in which often times we want our program to act differently based on the information supplied to it. In Javascript it uses control flow like any other languages, we just need to understand and be able to use different operators and how to use them.<br/>

## Explain type coercion, using examples from the JavaScript programming language

---

### Type Coercion

Type Coercion is that the process of converting type of value from one type to a different like string to boolean, object to boolean, and so on. Any type, be it primitive or an object, could be a valid subject for type coercion. <br/>

![type_coercion](docs/type_coercion.png)<br/>

| Types of Coercion          |                                                                            Description                                                                            |            Example             |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| Explicit or â€˜Type castingâ€™ |                                   This happens when the programmer explicitly converts the kind of value to the required type.                                    | ![explicit](docs/explicit.png) |
| Implicit                   | They are the sort of conversions that are hidden. JavaScript being the weakly-typed language, values are often converted between differing types of â€˜implicitlyâ€™. | ![implicit](docs/implicit.png) |

| Boolean conversion  | To explicitly convert the value to a boolean type Boolean(..) function is used. a bit like the unary + operator coerces a worth to variety the unary !== operator explicitly coerces a worth to a boolean. '!' operator explicitly inverses the truthy to falsy and the other way around. Any value utilized in these contexts that's not already a boolean will first be implicitly coerced to a boolean. Both Or and And operators perform a boolean test on the primary operand (a or c). For the OR operator, if the test is true, the OR expression ends up in the value of the primary operand (a or c). If the test is fake, the OR expression ends up in the value of the second operand (b). Inversely, for the && operator, if the test is true, the && expression ends up in the value of the second operand (b). If the test not true, the AND expression ends up in the value of the primary operand (a or c). This test returns the primary falsy value. | Explicit <br/> ![boolean_explicit](docs/boolean_explicit.png) <br/> Implicit <br/> ![boolean_implicit](docs/boolean_implicit.png) | <br/> |

|                                  | **do...while** loop will always run the first iteration.                                                                                                                                                                  |   ![do_while](docs/do_while.png)   |
|                                  | **forEach** will iterate through every entry of the array which takes a callback function where you can execute code.                                                                                                     |   ![for_each](docs/for_each.png)   |
| Find Element in Array            | **Array.find** will return the element in the array with the given condition.                                                                                                                                             |       ![find](docs/find.png)       |
|                                  | **Array.findIndex** will return the index of the element in the array with the given condition.                                                                                                                           | ![find_index](docs/find_index.png) |
| Check if Element Exists in Array | **Array.includes** checks if an item exists in an array.                                                                                                                                                                  |   ![includes](docs/includes.png)   |
|                                  | **Array.some** checks if some items meet the condition given. It takes a callback function which returns a boolean for the condition.                                                                                     |       ![some](docs/some.png)       |
|                                  | **Array.every** checks if every item meet the condition given. It takes a callback function which returns a boolean for the condition.                                                                                    |      ![every](docs/every.png)      |
| Check If an Object Is an Array   | **Array.isArray** checks if an object given is an array. It is a convenient way to check if an element is an array.                                                                                                       |      ![array](docs/array.png)      |
| Remove Duplicates in Array       | **Set** is a object that cannot have duplicate entries. You can create a new **Set** from an array then convert it back to an array.                                                                                      |        ![set](docs/set.png)        |

|                                  | **Array.splice(index, numberOfItems)** Remove array item in place with the given index, and then numberOfItems after it.                                                                                                  |     ![splice](docs/splice.png)     |
|                                  | **Array.sort** sorts array in place according to the condition you return in **sortFunction**.                                                                                                                            |       ![sort](docs/sort.png)       |
|                                  | **Array.fill** will add or replace the element with the element specified from _startIndex_ to _endIndex_.                                                                                                                |       ![fill](docs/fill.png)       |
|                                  | **Array.flat** function does not do a good job of recursively flatten arrays. The depth is limited and it does not flatten all kinds of nested array structures.                                                          |       ![flat](docs/flat.png)       |
|                                  | **Array.join** will return a string by concatenating the entries after they are converted to string with separator between each entry.                                                                                    |       ![join](docs/join.png)       |
|                                  | **Array.indexOf** will return the first index of the _elementToFind_ in the array.                                                                                                                                        |   ![index_of](docs/index_of.png)   |
|                                  | **Array.lastIndexOf** will return the last index of the elementToFind in the array.                                                                                                                                       | ![last_index](docs/last_index.png) |
|                                  | **Array.push** adds a new element to an array.                                                                                                                                                                            |       ![push](docs/push.png)       |
|                                  | **Array.pop** removes the last element of the array.                                                                                                                                                                      |        ![pop](docs/pop.png)        |
|                                  | **Array.map** returns a new array which transforms the existing arrayâ€™s element by calling the mapFunction . mapFunction takes one argument, which is the array element.                                                  |        ![map](docs/map.png)        |

| Object Manipulation         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |               Example                |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------: |
| Accessing Object Properties | We are able to access object properties in two other ways. one among them is bracket notation and another is that the dot notation.                                                                                       | ![bracket_dot](docs/bracket_dot.png) |
| Get Values from an Object   | Object.values() returns an array of the values of an object                                                                                                                                                               |      ![values](docs/values.png)      |
| Get Keys from an Object     | Object.keys() gives back an array of the keys of an its object.                                                                                                                                                           |        ![keys](docs/keys.png)        |
| Object To Array Entries     | Object.entries() creates an array that contains arrays of key/value pairs of an object.                                                                                                                                   |     ![entries](docs/entries.png)     |
| Merging Object with Spread  | Merging two objects which returns a brand new object.                                                                                                                                                                     |       ![merge](docs/merge.png)       |
| Combining Two Object        | Object.assign() is comparable to the spread operator. It allows for objects to be combined together.                                                                                                                      |      ![assign](docs/assign.png)      |
| Freezing An Object          | Object.freeze() prevents from modifying existing properties or adding new properties and values within the object. Itâ€™s often what people think const does, however const allows you to change an object.                 |      ![freeze](docs/freeze.png)      |
| Object Frozen or Not        | The Object.isFrozen() determines if an object is frozen. Return Boolean value.                                                                                                                                            |      ![frozen](docs/frozen.png)      |
| Sealing an Object           | Object.seal() seals an object, preventing new properties from being added thereto and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. Values of present properties can still be changed as long as they're writable. |        ![seal](docs/seal.png)        |
| Object Sealed or Not        | The Object.isSealed() method finds out if an object is sealed.                                                                                                                                                            |      ![sealed](docs/sealed.png)      |
| Localization                | Object.toLocaleString() method returns a string representing the article. This method is supposed to be overridden by derived objects for locale-specific purposes.                                                       |       ![local](docs/local.png)       |

| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------: |
| JSON.parse()      | To parse is to divide a sentence into grammatical parts and identify the parts and their relations to every other. In Software coding, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters. after we receive data from the API server, the information is often a string. We parse the information using JSON.parse() which turns the information into a JavaScript object. Before parsing it, it's just a string, some text and you can't access the information encoded in it. After parsing it, it becomes a JavaScript Object and you'll be able to access the information. |     ![parse](docs/parse.png)     |
| JSON.stringify()  | JSON.stringify() turns an object to a JSON string. When sending data to a back-end server, the information has got to be a string that converts an object into a string by using the function. It can take 2 additional arguments in which the first one being a replacer function and the second parameter is a string or number value to use as an area within the returned string.                                                                                                                                                                                          | ![stringify](docs/stringify.png) |
